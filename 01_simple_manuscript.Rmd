abstract: "This hands-on tutorial provides participants with an in-depth understanding of how to build on R Markdown to make their research workflows fully reproducible. Acknowledging the diversity of programming languages (e.g., R, Python, SQL) and types of research outputs (e.g., manuscripts, blog posts) that are common in computational social science, the tutorial showcases an integrated and automated R Markdown research project workflow. It familiarizes participants with the basic logic of R Markdown for research outputs, while extending this basic logic for scientific use cases by relying on the power of Pandoc and Lua."
thanks: "The acknowledgments go to everyone involved in creating free and open software and, in particular, to the author of the great bookdown page Yihui Xie."

# The basics

R Markdown offers a framework to generate reproducible research in various output formats (e.g., PDF reports, HTML documents). This Rmd file is optimized for the creation of a **stable PDF report**. The conversion from R code and Markdown text to the respective output format is implemented by the document conversion tool **Pandoc** that ships with the `rmarkdown` library. You can click on the `Knit` button in the RStudio IDE or call `rmarkdown::render("01_simple_manuscript.Rmd", "bookdown::pdf_document2")`.

This is a \LaTeX based manuscript that is generated from an Rmd-file by relying on Pandoc for conversion from Markdown to Tex. If you do not specify a `template.tex` in your `YAML` header, Pandoc will use the `default.latex` template, which you can find [here](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.latex). I suggest that you start writing reproducible research papers by focusing on integrating code and content before optimizing the beauty of your document (yes, this is important, too, and we will get there very soon).


## LaTeX and LaTeX packages

To compile a PDF report, you will need to have a working LaTeX installation on your machine. Alternatively, you may want to rely on `tinytex`, an R package that installs a very minimal LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live on your computer. Check if `tinytex:::is_tinytex()` returns `TRUE`. If not, you may install TinyTeX:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

You can manage your LaTeX packages by using `tinytex::tlmgr_install()` and `tinytex::tlmgr_remove()`. R Mardown will automatically install some LaTeX packages that are neccessary for compilation, for instance, the `hyperref` package.


## Citations

Markdown provides an easy way to cite and reference literature. We add a `bib`-file in our YAML header in the following way:


We can then cite all entries included in our `.bib`-file by calling `@palmerdata.2020` for inline citations and `[@palmerdata.2020, p.10]` for all other references. Here is an example: the dataset that we use has been created by @palmerdata.2020. If our document specifies a [csl](https://citationstyles.org/) [style](https://www.zotero.org/styles), Pandoc will convert Markdown references, i.e., `@palmerdata.2020`, to 'hardcoded' text and a hyperlink to the reference section in our document. If our document, in contrast, specifies a citation reference package like `biblatex` or `natbib` along with the related options, pandoc will create the corresponding LaTeX commands (e.g. `\autocite`, or `\pcite`) to create the references from our Markdown references.

## Figures and images

There are several different ways to include images in Rmd documents. For PDF outputs, like `bookdown::pdf_document2`, we can rely on

1. Plain markdown syntax: `![A cow's nose](figs/cow.jpg){width=30%}`(works for most output formats, hence, recommended)

![A cow's nose](figs/cow.jpg){width=30%}

2. \LaTeX syntax (not recommended)

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{./figs/snake.jpg}
\caption{A snake}
\end{figure}


3. Code evaluation and `knitr` (works for most output formats, hence, recommended)

```{r winter, out.width="30%", fig.cap="A winter morning", fig.align="center", echo=TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics(path = "figs/winter.jpg")
```


You can also place several images side-by-side by passing a vector of images to `knitr::include_graphics` and setting the chunk option `fig.show` to `hold`.

```{r, out.width='25%', fig.show='hold'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep('figs/snake.jpg', 3))

```

## Cross-referencing

Cross-referencing is possible in PDF documents when we rely on `bookdown::pdf_document2`. We can cross-reference sections, figures, tables or equations in our document with the following syntax: `\@ref(fig:winter)`. Here is an example: Figure \@ref(fig:winter) shows a photograph of Munich on a winter morning. If we specify the `colorlinks: true` option in our YAML header, the hyperlinks to the respective figure will be colored.

Similarly, we can also cross-reference sections, tables or equations. If you do not specify a section label, Pandoc will automatically assign a label based on the title of your header. For more details, see the [Pandoc manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-auto_identifiers). If you wish to add a manual label to a header, add `{#mylabel}` to the end of the section header. If you wish to make reference to an equation, you can rely on \LaTeX syntax and put your equations in equation environments and assign a label by `(\#eq:label)`, e.g.,


```{r equation, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation} 
```

\begin{equation}
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation}

See Equation \@ref(eq:binom).


# Integrating code and content


*Literate programming* is key to reproducible documents, which means that we can integrate our code and text into a single document. We can then also include any kind of operations directly in the text by calling R with a single backtick:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
`r (2+2)*5`
```
Here is an applied example. Let's calculate the mean bill length of penguins in the data and share this information with the readers, while rounding the number to two digits: `r round(mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = T), digits=2)` mm.

# Graphs - `ggplot`

```{r ggplot, fig.cap="Body mass and flipper length of penguins."}

mass_flipper <- ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  aes(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g
  )
) +
  geom_point(aes(
    color = species,
    shape = species
  ),
  size = 3,
  alpha = 0.8
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
    subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie,
       Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)",
    y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Penguin species",
    shape = "Penguin species"
  )


mass_flipper

```  



# Tables

In \LaTeX documents, Pandoc will automatically load the packages `longtable`, `booktabs`, and `calc` when we specify the option `tables: yes` in our YAML header.


## Including tables: `kable`

You can easily create and integrate your tables with the powerful table generating package `kable` and the table styling package `kableExtra`. For the full documentation of the package, see the [vignette](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf). Here is an example table including some summary statistics of the penguin species.


```{r kable-advanced}

kable(
  penguins %>%
    group_by(species) %>%
    # calculate mean by species
    summarize(across(
      where(is.numeric),
      ~ mean(., na.rm = T)
    )) %>%
    # drop the year variable for the print out
    select(-year),
  # enable booktabs option (only in PDFs)
  booktabs = T,
  format = "latex",
  # round to two digits
  digits = 2,
  # caption of the table
  caption = "Differences in Flipper and Bill Length across Penguin Species",
  # rename the columns
  col.names = c(
    "Species",
    "Bill Length\n(mm)",
    "Bill Depth\n(mm)",
    "Flipper Length\n(mm)",
    "Body Mass\n(kg)"
  )
) %>%
  # here we include any extra kableExtra options for the styling
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    latex_options = c(
      "hold",
      "striped",
      # option to fit a wide table
      "scale_down"
    )
  )

```


## Including output from regression tables: `modelsummary`

`modelsummary` is a very powerful package to present regression tables in several different output formats. Depending on your preferred table styling package, you can chose among different output formats and then further style the regression table according to your personal needs. In the example below, we use `kableExtra` to style the table.

```{r regression-table-modelsummary}

url <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/Pulse.csv'
pulse_data <- read_csv(url) %>%
  select(-X1)


models <- list(
  "M1" = lm(Rest ~ Smoke + Exercise + Wgt + Sex,
            data = pulse_data),
  "M2" = lm(Rest ~ Smoke*Exercise + Wgt + Sex,
            data = pulse_data),
  "M3" = lm(Active ~ Smoke + Exercise + Wgt + Sex,
            data = pulse_data),
  "M4" = lm(Active ~ Smoke*Exercise + Wgt + Sex,
            data = pulse_data)
)

# report only basic goodness-of-fit statistics
round_function <- function(x) format(round(x, 3))
gm <- list(
  list("raw" = "r.squared", "clean" = "R$^2$", "fmt" = round_function),
  list("raw" = "nobs", "clean" = "Num.Obs.", "fmt" = round_function)
  )

reg_table <- modelsummary(
  models,
  title = "Resting and active pulse rates as a function of sex, weight, exercise, and smoking habits among students",
  stars = TRUE,
  # report only basic goodness-of-fit stats
  gof_map = gm, 
  escape = FALSE
  )

reg_table %>%
  # column labels
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1,
                     "Resting Pulse" = 2,
                     "Active Pulse" = 2)) %>%
  # footnote
  add_footnote("Dataset: 'Pulse Rates and Exercise' from the Stat2Data package.",
               notation = "none"
  ) 

```

# Advanced literate programming

## Literate programming in figure captions

Sometimes, we would like to include the result of a specific evaluated code in the caption of a figure or a table. We can achieve this, by making use of the `knitr` code chunk option `eval.after`, which allows us to specify that the caption of our Figure should be evaluated only **after** the respective code chunk was evaluated by R. As a matter of fact, the default `eval.after` chunk option is set to include `fig.cap` [@Xie.2016]. In our example `ggplot`, we might, for instance, include the overall number of penguins that are included in the dataset to our earlier `ggplot`.

```{r lit-prog-caption, eval.after="fig.cap", fig.cap = paste0("Body mass and flipper length of penguins. N = ", nrow(penguins), ".")}

mass_flipper <- ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  aes(
    x = flipper_length_mm,
    y = body_mass_g
  )
) +
  geom_point(aes(
    color = species,
    shape = species
  ),
  size = 3,
  alpha = 0.8
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
    subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie,
       Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)",
    y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Penguin species",
    shape = "Penguin species"
  )

mass_flipper

```

## Working with other engines in Rmd

### Python with `reticulate` package

The `reticulate` package allows two-way communication between `python` and `R`, thus, you can access any objects created or stored within a `python`-engine chunk from within an `R`-enginge chunk, and *vice versa*. To use the `python`-engine, simply replace the name of the engine after the three backticks and the curly brace that opens a chunk.


# Tweaks in RStudio

There are a number of useful addins in RStudio that facilitate our workflow. The `styler` package is a useful addin to tidy your code, which is good practice before sharing your scripts.

## Attach R session info in appendix {#sec:rsessioninfo}

Since R and R packages are constantly evolving you might want to add the R session info that contains information on the R version as well as the packages that are loaded.

```{r echo=FALSE}
xfun::session_info()
```


## Print all the code

Sometimes, we would also like to show all code that was used in the different code chunks to produce the results. We can do so by creating a chunk that is not evaluate (`eval=FALSE`), but printed (`echo=FALSE`) and inherits all code of the chunks specified (`ref.label`) from all code chunks of our document (`knitr::all_lables()`).

```{r all-code, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, ref.label=knitr::all_labels()}
```
